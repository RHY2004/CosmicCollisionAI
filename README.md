# Asteroid Impact Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict potential asteroid impacts on Earth. The model leverages data from NASA's asteroid database to assess the likelihood of impact based on key parameters such as orbit characteristics and asteroid magnitude.

## Project Structure
- **Model Files**:
  - `best_random_forest_model.joblib`: The trained Random Forest model used for predictions.
  - `scaler.pkl`: Scaler used for preprocessing input data to ensure consistency with training data.

- **Backend**:
  - A Flask application that serves as a REST API to interact with the model and make predictions based on user input.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asteroid-impact-model.git
   cd asteroid-impact-model
   ```

2. Set Up the Environment:
   It's recommended to create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages.
   bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. Run the Flask API:
   Start the Flask server to serve the model:
   bash
   python app.py
   
   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/predict`.

## How to Use
To make predictions with the model, send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with the following JSON structure:

### Request Format:
json
{
  "orbit_axis": 1.5,
  "orbit_eccentricity": 0.1,
  "perihelion_distance": 1.3,
  "aphelion_distance": 1.7,
  "min_orbit_intersection_distance": 0.02,
  "asteroid_magnitude": 20
}


 Example cURL Command:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "orbit_axis": 1.5,
  "orbit_eccentricity": 0.1,
  "perihelion_distance": 1.3,
  "aphelion_distance": 1.7,
  "min_orbit_intersection_distance": 0.02,
  "asteroid_magnitude": 20
}'
```

 Response:
The response will contain the prediction and probability:
```json
{
  "impact": "Impact Possible",
  "probability": 0.85
}
```
